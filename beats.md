## the skeleton

so what I do first is decide on the essence of the beat which for me is the kicks/snares. so for dnb it will probably something like this:

note that the snares are on the 2 and 4, that's common or regular time
in dubstep I think you often use half-time which puts the snare on 3 only:

(if you put the snare on every half beat, that's doubletime and you get punk-rock :o))

after I have a pattern I like, I'll often double up those kicks/snares with thick edm samples. we'll add some more snares in later, those I usually don't double up as to not kill the dynamics.
to keep the spectrum clean, I then put a highpass on the whole drum plugin, but not the edm double ups


## high frequencies

to add some drive and high frequencies, we'll add some hihats. depending on how busy you want the beat, add 8th or 16th on every possible location in the drumroll:

since this is a bit boring, I then vary the type of hit the hihat does (how the stick of the drummer impacts the hat).
depending on your plugin you might not have a lot of options here, but you can at least mix in some open hats and pedal closes:

in this example, G#4 is open hat and E4 is a pedal close
try and keep the ornaments on the straight beats (1-2-3-4) at first so the beat doesn't get wonky (which is totally legit, if you feel it tho)

then I add some dynamics by shifting the velocity of the hats down a bit, especially on the off-beats, try to keep the on-beats a bit louder to keep the flow going:

## spooky ghosts

to make the beat more complex, I then add some ghost notes to the snare
that's just extra 8th or 16th after the snare beats. tone them down in velocity quite a bit, they're just there for faint details:

## tomfills

this is a bit harder to explain. generally you should have like 3-4 toms (high, mid, low). typical fills would just run down the line, like

SNR-SNR, HI-HI, MID-MID, LO-LO. that's your basic fill:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f858434-0e07-42b3-91da-9649087d1e6e)

you can do all kinds of things like going faster with 16th, or adding some kicks into the mix:

I think the best general advice I can give here is to keep the fill going from high to low, keep some kind of accent on the beats (snares or toms) and don't be afraid to experiment
